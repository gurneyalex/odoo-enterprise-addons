# In the module, we want to:
#
# add the display_type field on sale subscription lines with the same definition
# as the same field on sale order lines
# change the method of sale.order which are responsible for the creation of the
# creation of the subscription lines:
# the lines with a display_type of "note" or "section" must be included too (not
# only the lines with a subscription product)
# however empty sections must be skipped (if you find two consecutive
# "sections", without a product line in between the first one
# must be removed. Same if the last section has no products: remove it)
# the display_type of the line must be passed to the newly created subscription
# line change the way invoices are generated from a subscription:
# in the _prepare_invoice_line method of the subscription, pass the value of
# the display_type of the subscription line
# in the form view of the contract, just display the display_type field
# of the lines in a new column of the tree view (1st column).
